Using Vagrant to run a Webstrates server
========================================

To configure and run a virtual machine running Webstrates:
 * Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
 * Checkout the files of this folder to your local machine 
 * Open the folder in a terminal and type `vagrant up`
 * After vagrant has finished starting and configuring the VM Webstrates will be available on port 7007 of your local machine.
 
__NB:__ This Vagrant script will install a fresh Ubuntu server which requires around 2GB of disk space
